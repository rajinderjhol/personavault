step-by-step guide to restart and test your application connected to Ollama. This guide assumes you’re using a MacBook and have already set up Ollama and your Flask application. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask!

Step 1: Ensure Ollama is Running
Start Ollama:

Open a terminal and run:

bash
Copy
ollama serve
This starts the Ollama server on http://localhost:11434.

Verify Ollama is Running:

Open another terminal and test the Ollama API:

bash
Copy
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama2",
  "prompt": "Hello, how are you?"
}'
If Ollama is running correctly, you should see a stream of responses.

Step 2: Restart Your Flask Application
Navigate to Your Project Directory:

Open a terminal and go to your project folder:

bash
Copy
cd /Users/raj/Documents/software/personavault/backend
Activate the Virtual Environment:

If you’re using a virtual environment, activate it:

bash
Copy
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

Ensure all dependencies are installed:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask Application:

Start the Flask app:

bash
Copy
python app.py
The app should start running on http://localhost:5001.

Step 3: Test the Chatbot
Open the Frontend:

Open your browser and navigate to:

Copy
http://localhost:5001
You should see your chatbot interface.

Send a Message:

Type a message in the chat input box and click "Send".

The message should be sent to the Flask backend, which forwards it to Ollama for a response.

Check the Response:

If everything is working, you should see the AI’s response in the chat window.

Step 4: Monitor System Resources
Open Activity Monitor:

On your Mac, open Activity Monitor (you can search for it in Spotlight).

Check CPU and Memory Usage:

Look for processes like ollama, python, or Flask in the list.

Ensure CPU and memory usage are within reasonable limits (e.g., not consistently at 100%).

Step 5: Debugging and Troubleshooting
Check Flask Logs:

If the chatbot isn’t working, check the terminal where Flask is running for error messages.

Check Ollama Logs:

If Ollama isn’t responding, check the terminal where ollama serve is running for errors.

Test Ollama Directly:

If the chatbot fails, test Ollama directly using curl (as shown in Step 1) to ensure it’s working.

Check Network Connectivity:

Ensure your Flask app can reach Ollama at http://localhost:11434.

Step 6: Automate Restart (Optional)
If you want to automatically restart your Flask app or Ollama if they crash, you can use a process manager like supervisord or pm2. Here’s a simple example using supervisord:

Install Supervisor:

bash
Copy
brew install supervisor
Create a Supervisor Configuration:

Create a file at /usr/local/etc/supervisord.ini and add:

ini
Copy
[program:flask]
command=/Users/raj/Documents/software/personavault/backend/venv/bin/python /Users/raj/Documents/software/personavault/backend/app.py
directory=/Users/raj/Documents/software/personavault/backend
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/flask.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/flask.out.log

[program:ollama]
command=ollama serve
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/ollama.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/ollama.out.log
Start Supervisor:

bash
Copy
supervisord
Check Status:

bash
Copy
supervisorctl status
Step 7: Test Again
Repeat Step 3 to ensure everything is working after restarting.

Common Issues and Fixes
Ollama Not Responding:

Ensure Ollama is running and accessible at http://localhost:11434.

Check for errors in the terminal where ollama serve is running.

Flask App Not Starting:

Ensure the virtual environment is activated.

Check for missing dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

High CPU/Memory Usage:

Use a smaller model (e.g., llama2-7b).

Limit the response length with num_predict.
