It allows users to create, join, and manage shared sessions where they can collaborate with others in real-time. Here’s a breakdown of the use cases and the UI components needed to support them:

Use Cases for Shared Sessions
Create a Session:

A user can create a new shared session and invite others to join.

The session creator can set permissions (e.g., read-only, read-write).

Join a Session:

Users can join an existing session by entering a session ID or clicking an invite link.

Once joined, users can see the chat history and participate in real-time.

View Active Users:

Users in a session can see a list of other participants currently active in the session.

Real-Time Collaboration:

All users in the session can send messages, save memories, and see updates in real-time.

Changes made by one user (e.g., saving a memory) are immediately visible to others.

Leave a Session:

Users can leave a session at any time, and their presence is removed from the active users list.

Session Permissions:

The session creator can assign roles (e.g., admin, contributor, viewer) to control what actions users can perform.

UI Components for Shared Sessions
To support these use cases, we’ll need the following UI components:

Session Creation Modal:

A modal dialog where users can create a new session.

Fields:

Session Name

Permissions (e.g., read-only, read-write)

Invite Link (automatically generated)

Session Join Modal:

A modal dialog where users can join an existing session.

Fields:

Session ID or Invite Link

Active Users Panel:

A sidebar or panel that displays the list of active users in the session.

Each user’s name and role (e.g., admin, contributor) should be displayed.

Session Controls:

Buttons for managing the session:

Leave Session

Invite More Users

Change Permissions (for admins)

Real-Time Chat Enhancements:

Indicate which user sent each message in the chat window.

Show typing indicators for other users.

Proposed UI Layout
Here’s how the UI for shared sessions could be integrated into the existing ChatWidget.js:

javascript
Copy
// ==================== //
// ChatWidget.js - UI for Shared Sessions
// ==================== //

export class ChatWidget {
    constructor(containerId, apiEndpoint) {
        this.container = document.getElementById(containerId);
        this.apiEndpoint = apiEndpoint;
        this.messageHistory = [];
        this.isTyping = false;
        this.recognition = null;
        this.speechSynthesis = window.speechSynthesis;
        this.sentimentAnalyzer = new Sentiment();
        this.aiPersonality = 'formal';
        this.language = 'en-US';
        this.isVoiceOutputEnabled = false;

        // WebSocket connection
        this.websocket = null;
        this.sessionId = null;
        this.activeUsers = [];

        if (!this.container) {
            console.error(`Error: Container with ID "${containerId}" not found.`);
            return;
        }

        this.init();
    }

    init() {
        console.log('Initializing ChatWidget...');

        // Render the chat widget UI
        this.container.innerHTML = `
